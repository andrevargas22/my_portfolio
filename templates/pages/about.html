                        Hello and welcome to my site! My name is André Vargas, I am a Machine Learning Engineer currently working at Grupo Casas Bahia, 
                        one of Brazil's largest retailers.
                        <br><br>
                        My journey in tech began with a degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Universidade de Brasília, I also spent one year studying at 
                        Cardiff University (UK). My first professional job was as a Hardware Engineer, focusing on IoT, industrial automation and digital transformation. 
                        After a few years, my fascination with data and its potential to drive innovation led me to pivot towards Data Science and Machine Learning. 
                        <br><br>
                        After gaining experience as a Data Scientist, I became deeply interested in MLOps. I’ve since developed expertise in building and deploying ML 
                        and MLOps solutions, designing cloud architectures, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and creating production-ready models and APIs.
                        <br><br>
                        I am passionate about studying and consider myself self-taught in many areas. Despite not being a web designer by trade, I built this website from scratch, 
                        incorporating cool features using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all of which I learned on my own. With all the available resources we have today, 
                        I truly believe we can learn anything we set our minds to.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of work, I share my life with my amazing wife, Maria, and our dog, Bibi. I also love playing the drums and I love video games, 
                        I even made a list of games I've already finished in my "Other Projects" section, which I personally think is pretty cool! Feel free to
                        get in touch, I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations!
